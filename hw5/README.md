## HW5: LSTM Implementation

File Descriptions
- `lstm_seq2seq.ipynb`(GloVe embeddings) runs all pre-processing, computation, training/validation/testing, model evaluation
- `lstm_seq2seq_random.ipynb` is the same as above but using random embeddings
- `model.py` has classes `Custom_LSTM`, `Encoder`, `Decoder`, and `S2S`
- `predictions_glove.txt` has all predictions from the model for the GloVe embeddings
- `incorrect_predictions_glove.txt` has all the instances of where the model was incorrect on the test set
- `sample_sentences.txt` has sample sentences with input, prediction, and correct ouput
- `correctness.txt` has words ranked in terms of correctness/incorrectness
