## About this Repository:
This repo contains the code used for my machine learning class CAAM 37710 at UChicago for Spring 2024.
- Each homework's code is separated into respective folders
- Details about where code, plots, or writeups can be found are in each respective homework folder
### HW1: k-means Algorithm
- Implementation of k-means and k-means++ algorithms for vectors in $R^2$ (toy data)
- Implementation of k-means and k-means++ algorithms for vectors in $R^{784}$ (MNIST data)

### HW2: Perceptron Algorithm
- Implementation of perceptron algorithm based on 2,000 training images categorized as either 3 or 5 from the MNIST data set
- Makes predictions about 200 test images with labels found in `hw2/data/test35.predictions`
